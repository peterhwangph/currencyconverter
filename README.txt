App Description:
Throughout the course of this semester in CMSC335, I had the opportunity to learn Javascript, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB.
And so as a result, I created a website encompassing all those tools that would not only allow users to convert currencies,
but also add, search, and delete a userâ€™s credentials from the adjacent database. Additionally, all entries in the database
will be displayed on a plot on the home page, organized by age demographic.
